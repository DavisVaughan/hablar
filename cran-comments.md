## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1
* win-builder 

## R CMD check results Mac and win builder:
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## R CMD check results Ubuntu:
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 1 NOTE

* 'license' file found in top directory. 

Comment: file LICENSE is exaxtly the same as other packages. I can't see why Ubuntu finds a NOTE in checking it while windows and mac does not.
